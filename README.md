# QS_modelling
These files implement the Quorum sensing model described in the work "The acquisition of additional feedback loops may optimize and speed up the response of quorum sensing" by Marco Fondi, Francesca Di Patti and Elena Perrin. The code was developed and Run under MATLAB 2019. 

To reproduce the figures and the analyses shown in the work, just run the main.m script from a MATLAB command window (paying attention to acctually be in the same folder of the scirpt or to have included the path to the folder in the MATLAB path).
